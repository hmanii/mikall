Define your CI/CD pipeline in .gitlab-ci.yml:

    Create a file named .gitlab-ci.yml in the root of your project repository.
    This file defines the stages (e.g., build, test, deploy) and jobs within each stage that GitLab CI/CD will execute.
    Each job specifies scripts to run, environment variables, dependencies, and artifacts to save.


    stages:
      - build
      - test
      - deploy

    build-job:
      stage: build
      script:
        - echo "Building the project..."
        # Add your build commands here (e.g., npm install, webpack build)

    test-job:
      stage: test
      script:
        - echo "Running tests..."
        # Add your test commands here (e.g., npm test, pytest)

    deploy-prod:
      stage: deploy
      script:
        - echo "Deploying to production..."
        # Add your deployment commands here (e.g., SSH commands, cloud deployment tools)
      environment: production # Define the environment for tracking deployments
      rules:
        - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH # Deploy only from the default branch


Configure GitLab Runners:
    GitLab Runners are agents that execute the jobs defined in your .gitlab-ci.yml file.
    You can use shared GitLab Runners or register your own specific runners for your project, potentially on your deployment target server.
    Runners need to be configured with the necessary tools and access rights to perform the deployment steps. 

Set up Deployment Credentials and Variables:
    Store sensitive information like API keys, SSH private keys, or cloud credentials as CI/CD variables within your GitLab project settings (Settings > CI/CD > Variables).
    Use masked and protected variables for security. 

Trigger the Pipeline:
    Pushing changes to your repository (especially the branch configured for deployment) will automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
    You can also manually trigger pipelines or schedule them.


Static Sites (GitLab Pages):
For static websites, configure GitLab Pages in your .gitlab-ci.yml to build and deploy your site to GitLab Pages.
Cloud Deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure):
Integrate with cloud providers using their respective CLI tools or GitLab's built-in integrations (e.g., for Kubernetes, Cloud Run).
Server Deployments (SSH):
Use SSH commands within your deploy job to connect to your server and perform deployment tasks like pulling the latest code, restarting services, etc.
